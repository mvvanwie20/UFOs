# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to assist Dana with her webpage documenting UFO sightings around the world. We originally created a webpage that only filtereed the UFO data by date but Dana wanted more input possibilities and so we added four more filter options: city, state, country and shape.
## Results
Dana can now use the webpage to filter the data in multiple ways by entering input to the search bars and then hitting search as shown in the image ![search bars](https://github.com/mvvanwie20/UFOs/blob/main/ufo.png). each field should be filled out with an input to make the search as efficient as possible.

## Summary
The biggest drawback to this design is that the user needs to know what to enter in the field as they must type the input. A solution to this would be to create a dropdown for the filtering options that have limited responses such as countries and shape. Date, and cities could remain as type answers since there are so many options.
